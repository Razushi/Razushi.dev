- Profit-Taker: Velocitus with Radiation/Corrosive, Rubedo-Lined Barrel + Dual Rounds.
- Open world: Larkspur Prime for add clear; keep `Automatic Trigger` if you like beams.
- Always slot `Hollowed Bullets` + `Marked Target` for status speed on Archguns.
- Grab an Archgun Riven if cheap; crit/multi/status are the priorities.
