Loadout sketches to copy/paste into DIM:

- **Arc Titan (PvE strikes):** Thundercrash + Cuirass, Storm Grenade + Touch of Thunder, Pulse + LMG, Surge mods.
- **Void Hunter (raids):** Tether + Orpheus, Volatile Rounds, Witherhoard + Funnelweb, Reaper/Utility Kickstart.
- **Solar Warlock (add clear):** Well + Phoenix, Fusion Grenade + Touch of Flame, Incandescent primary, Ashes to Assets.
- **Strand Titan (champ work):** Banner of War loop, Grapple + Drengr’s Lash, Out-of-Bounds + Retrofit Escapade, Monochromatic Maestro.

Seasonal notes:

- Run Focusing Lens / Low Entropy Superconductor equivalents when the artifact offers them.
- Keep one kinetic scout and pulse with anti-champ mods each season.
- For GM prep, pair a burst primary with a wave-frame GL and a heavy GL/rocket; spec triple resist.
