description: Tracking which relics and parts are worth cracking this week.

Keeping prime parts organized saves time and plat. This is my current rotation:

- **Relics to crack:** Axi A14, Neo N21, Lith M14
- **Parts to buy if cheap:** Khora Prime Blueprint, Soma Prime Barrel
- **Dupe tax:** Donate duplicate parts to clan vault for trades

### Notes
- Keep 1–2 Radiant relics per part you still need.
- Run with a farming squad (Khora/Equinox + Nekros) to speed it up.
- If Baro brings Primed Flow/Continuity, stash 2 spares for friends.
