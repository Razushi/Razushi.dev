Quick notes for a clean run:

- Early game: Firelink buy the key, grab the Estus Shard in High Wall, detour for the Mail Breaker if doing rapier setups.
- Mid game: Farron → Cathedral → Archives to keep level curve smooth; take Dancer early if confident.
- Rings to grab: Chloranthy +3, Havel’s +3, Prisoner’s Chain for stat spread.
- Weapons: Sharp sellsword, Refined broadsword, or Raw axe early; infuse once you hit 18–20 STR/DEX.
- Buffs: Carthus Flame Arc for early bosses; Lightning Blade for late game.

Boss reminders:

- Vordt: Stay behind, punish breath.
- Abyss Watchers: Save resins for phase 2, roll into flame waves.
- Pontiff: Parry window on second swing; otherwise bait teleport slam.
- Twins: Kill Lorian, dodge the teleport overhead, punish the recovery.
