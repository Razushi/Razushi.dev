Quick hits for the wyvern clear:

- Start at Anor Londo bonfire, sprint past the silver knights.
- Grab the resin near the first archer; free buff before the bridge.
- Kill the wyvern with headshots; Lightning Spear is safer than melee.
- Pick up embers on the drop route; worth ~3 per loop.
- Reset at bonfire, repeat.
