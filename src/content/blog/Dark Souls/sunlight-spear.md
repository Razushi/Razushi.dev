# **Sunlight Spear — DS3 Notes**

## Overview

Sunlight Spear is the **final Lightning miracle** in *Dark Souls III*, obtained after offering the *Soul of the Lords* to the **Sunlight Altar**.
It’s effectively the strongest "throwing lightning" miracle and scales extremely hard with **Faith**, especially when used as a Warrior of Sunlight.

---

## Acquisition

### -# Requirements

* Soul of the Lords
* Altar of Sunlight (via Warrior of Sunlight covenant)
* Transpose the soul with Ludleth
* 45 Faith (minimum for effective use)

---

## Basic Scaling Table

| Stat               | Value                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| FP Cost            | 55                           |
| Faith Requirement  | 40                           |
| Max Damage Tier    | ~60–70 Faith                 |
| Spell Buff Scaling | Strongest on Yorshka’s Chime |

---

## Usage Notes

* Deals **two hits**:

  1. The spear itself (projectile)
  2. A small lightning AoE on impact
* Damage is boosted significantly when cast with:

  * Yorshka’s Chime
  * Ring of the Sun’s First Born
  * Lightning Clutch Ring
  * Morion Blade + Red Tearstone (for low-HP setups)

---

## Example PvE Cast Rotation

```text
1. Sacred Oath (optional)
2. Lightning Blade (if using infused weapon)
3. Heal/reposition
4. Sunlight Spear → headshot if possible
```

---

## Example PvP Quick-Swap Macro (Pseudo-Script)

```bash
# pseudo-input sequence
equip-slot-2 = "Yorshka's Chime"
cast("Sunlight Spear")
roll-cancel()
swap-back()
```

---

## Strengths

* Very high single-target burst
* Fast cast compared to Lightning Stake
* Good at punishing recovery frames
* Synergises well with buff-heavy, Faith-focused builds

## Weaknesses

* High FP cost
* Easy to roll if not timed correctly
* Requires strong Faith investment

---

## Recommended Setup (Sample Build)

### -# Equipment

* **Yorshka’s Chime**
* **Canvas Talisman** (for poise-casting options)
* **Saint’s Hood / Fire Keeper Robes**
* **Lothric Knight Sword (Lightning-infused)**

### -# Rings

1. Ring of the Sun’s First Born
2. Morne’s Ring
3. Lightning Clutch Ring
4. Sage Ring (if not at 30 Dex for cast speed soft cap)

---

## Tips

* Aim for the *head* on large bosses (Nameless King Phase 1, Wyverns, Dragonslayer Armour) — the damage multiplier is significant.
* If you miss the projectile, the AoE still hits; learn spacing.
* Use during boss recovery animations to guarantee a hit.
