description: Quick results from swapping stances and heavy attack builds.
---

Some fast observations while testing melee setups:

- **Glaive Prime (heavy build):** Power Throw + Volatile Quick Return feels great for Steel Path demolysts.
- **Dual Swords (status build):** Weeping Wounds + Condition Overload still wins; Drifting Contact beats Gladiator Rush for consistency.
- **Stances:** Sovereign Outcast is smooth; Vermillion Storm is flashy but slower on heavy builds.
- **Element stack:** Viral + Heat outperforms Corrosive on most Grineer steel path nodes right now.

### Action items
- Craft another Heavy Trauma to avoid swapping builds.
- Forma the Glaive Prime once more for a flexible polarity.
- Try a pure heavy slam build on Fragor Prime for fun.
