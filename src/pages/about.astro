        I work with the parts of computing most people never see: Linux systems administration,
        networking, virtualisation, and general systems engineering. I run NixOS across multiple
        machines with reproducible configs, custom modules, and a consistent toolchain everywhere.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m finishing my IT degree at UTS. Most of my study and work is around Linux, cloud
        infrastructure, distributed systems, and automation. I’ve built Kubernetes prototypes, local
        video-processing pipelines, DNS/DHCP lab networks, and platform setups using Docker, MinIO,
        Kafka, and related tools. I’ve also worked in Windows–Linux hybrid environments (Windows
        Server, CentOS Stream, VMware).
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of infrastructure, I write code when needed—mostly C++, C#, and Java—to build tools,
        automate workflows, or support the systems I run. I like minimal abstractions and configs I
        can reproduce exactly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond tech I spend time in Blender for 3D, take photos, and keep structured documentation
        systems. I also read Chinese web fiction and cook, usually Chinese dishes from Yunnan or
        nearby regions.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site is where I store notes, write-ups, and reference material. It’s primarily for me,
        but it’s public in case it’s useful to someone else.
