    <h1>Systems, infrastructure, and reproducible setups.</h1>

    <p>
      I work with the parts of computing most people never see: Linux systems administration,
      networking, virtualisation, and general systems engineering. I run NixOS across multiple
      machines with reproducible configs, custom modules, and a consistent toolchain everywhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m finishing my IT degree at UTS. Most of my study and work is around Linux, cloud
      infrastructure, distributed systems, and automation. I’ve built Kubernetes prototypes, local
      video-processing pipelines, DNS/DHCP lab networks, and platform setups using Docker, MinIO,
      Kafka, and related tools. I’ve also worked in Windows–Linux hybrid environments (Windows
      Server, CentOS Stream, VMware).
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of infrastructure, I write code when needed—mostly C++, C#, and Java—to build tools,
      automate workflows, or support the systems I run. I like minimal abstractions and configs I
      can reproduce exactly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond tech I spend time in Blender for 3D, take photos, and keep structured documentation
      systems. I also read Chinese web fiction and cook, usually Chinese dishes from Yunnan or
      nearby regions.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site is where I store notes, write-ups, and reference material. It’s primarily for me,
      but it’s public in case it’s useful to someone else.
